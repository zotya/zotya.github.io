# Development guidelines

First see [Software standards of EEA and Eionet](http://www.eionet.europa.eu/software/swstandards) (OBS: obsolete link see [issue #1](https://github.com/eea/docs/issues/1)) for general guidelines on developing software for the EEA and Eionet.

## Design

EEA products must follow the [EEA corporate design manual](http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/eea-corporate-design-manual), and also use the [web design elements](http://www.eea.europa.eu/code/design-elements) for web based products.

Eionet web based products must follow the Eionet [Website Design Guidelines](http://www.eionet.europa.eu/software/design).

## Development methodology

All development work should be recorded in our task management system [Taskman](https://taskman.eionet.europa.eu).

The methodology to follow is a blend of Scrum and Kanban, see [Working with tickets in Taskman](https://taskman.eionet.europa.eu/projects/netpub/wiki/Working_with_tickets_in_Taskman_(Flow)) for a guide on the workflow.

## Licensing

The license to be used for our projects is the [Mozilla Public License v2](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/) or the compatible more used [GNU General Public License v3, GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), see the historical [explanation on the initial choice of the license](http://www.eionet.europa.eu/software/licenseexplained.html).

## Source code management

Our software is managed on GitHub within the [EEA organisation account](https://github.com/eea). For legacy reason, some software is still also managed in Subversion on the [Eionet SVN server](http://svn.eionet.europa.eu/).

The software is built and tested with our continous integragation (CI) tool [Jenkins](http://ci.eionet.europa.eu/).
