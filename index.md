# Welcome1!

## About us

### EEA

The European Environment Agency (EEA) is an agency of the European Union. Our task is to provide sound, independent information on the environment. We are a major information source for those involved in developing, adopting, implementing and evaluating environmental policy, and also the general public.

### Eionet

Eionet is a partnership network of the European Environment Agency (EEA) and its member and cooperating countries. It consists of the EEA itself, six European Topic Centres (ETCs) and a network of around 1000 experts from 39 countries in over 350 national environment agencies and other bodies dealing with environmental information. The Eionet partnership is crucial to the EEA in supporting the collection and organisation of data through Reportnet and the development and dissemination of information.
