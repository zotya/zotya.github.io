# Documentation guidelines

This section describes how we manage software documentation.

## To update existing content

Use the link `Edit this page` on the bottom of each page to find the right file in the repository, and update the contents directly using the GitHub markdown editor.

You can also clone the entire repo `https://github.com/eea/docs` and use the standard git commands to edit. This is useful if you intend to edit several pages at once.

## To add new content

Here in the repository [https://github.com/eea/docs/tree/gh-pages](https://github.com/eea/docs/tree/gh-pages), 

1. add a new folder in the format `My-new-folder-name`
2. add a new file to the folder named `index.md`
3. update [https://github.com/eea/docs/blob/gh-pages/_data/menu.yml](https://github.com/eea/docs/blob/gh-pages/_data/menu.yml) accordingly. Each menu item is described by two lines - first line is the menu title, second line is the URL to the folder just created.
